# QR-Based Attendance System

## Overview
This is a Python-based desktop application designed to automate student attendance tracking using QR code scanning. The system uses a webcam to scan QR codes, each representing a student's unique ID, and logs attendance data securely in a MySQL database. The project was developed as part of my MCA coursework to demonstrate skills in Python programming, database integration, and computer vision.

## Features
- **Real-Time QR Code Scanning**: Uses a webcam to scan QR codes for attendance marking.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Tkinter for an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI).
- **Secure Data Storage**: Stores attendance records (student ID, timestamp) in a MySQL database.
- **Image Processing**: Handles QR code images using the PIL library.
- **Error-Free Tracking**: Ensures accurate attendance with minimal manual intervention.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Tkinter, OpenCV, Pyzbar, PIL (Pillow), MySQL Connector
- **Database**: MySQL
